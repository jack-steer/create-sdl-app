I have installed homebrew from https://brew.sh
I typed in terminal brew install sdl2
Project -> Build Settings -> Search Paths -> Header Search Paths, add value "/usr/local/include"
Build Phases -> Headers, Add a new entry in project in /usr/local/Cellar/sdl2/2.28.5/include/SDL2
In General Frameworks & Libraries put libSDL2-2.0.0.dylib (its here /usr/local/Cellar/sdl2/2.0.14_1/lib)
And most important I have checked Disable Library Validations in Signing & Capabilities
